What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates .git folder with git specific metadata. THis is the first step
in creating a repository
Now there will be no commit and all the files will be untracked.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains all files
Staging area is where there are files that are tracked by git but not part of commit yet
It is an intermediate step from which you can move stuff to a commit 
or revert the changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Move only the files relevant to the logical commit from working directory to staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Independent pieces of work. Parellel explorations that don't necessarily fit into the main branch of work. Allows context-switchng between different works -such as feature branch and bug-fixes. Keeps them isolated.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Can tell when the branches diverged, what was the last commit that is common to both branches and which changes can be present in one but not the other.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

   Changes from both branches are now integrated in one branch. Because the new commit has pointers back to both parents.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
